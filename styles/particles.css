/* 
  Explanation:
  
  - The ".all-circles-container" acts as a container for the entire animated circles effect. It's positioned absolutely and centered using the "transform" property. It hides any overflowing content.
  
  - The ".circle_container" represents each individual container for a moving circle. It's positioned relatively to its parent container. The "transform-origin" property is set to "left center" to control the origin of the circle's movement.
  
  - The ".circle" class styles each circle element. It's absolutely positioned and given a border-radius of 100% to create a circular shape. The "background" property sets the color and opacity of the circle.
  
  - The "@keyframes move" rule defines the animation sequence for the circles. In this example, the circles start at 0% opacity and move to the right. At 1%, their opacity increases, creating a gradual appearance. At 50%, they've moved to the right by 70px and their opacity reduces to 0.5. Finally, at 100%, they move to 140px to the right and their opacity becomes 0, creating a disappearing effect.
