                NeurIPS - 37th Anniversary Conference has sanctioned hotel rooms
                with special pricing at the Hotel/s available August 20th. The
                hotel links will be listed here. We urge you to make your
                reservations at the designated NeurIPS sanctioned Hotels through
                the link coming soon in support of the conference. Bypassing the
                room block impedes the Conference's ability to provide
                competitive pricing to you. Making your reservations through the
                conference links and staying at these official conference hotels
                helps us keep costs low and protect NeurIPS. The Neural
                Information Processing Systems Foundation is a non-profit
