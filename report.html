              The essential story being told by my website is about "AI
              Ascendancy" and its focus on various aspects of the field of
              Artificial Intelligence (AI), including news, tools, jobs, and
              conferences. The website aims to provide a comprehensive platform
              for individuals interested in AI, catering to both beginners and
              professionals in the field.
            </li>
            <li>
              On my website you can see 5 different pages: Main Page, AI News
              Page, AI Tools Page, AI Jobs Page and AI Conferences page. Each of
              these pages features a user-friendly, well-organized and clean
              layout for easy navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The structure of my website has a tree structure, with a central
              main page that serves as a hub for navigating to four other
              interconnected pages. These pages share a consistent footer,
              navbar, and background design.

          <ul class="report-section__answers">
            <li>
              Each and every image within the content is accompanied by
              alternative tags, which provide descriptive information for
              accessibility purposes. Furthermore, elements that are clickable,
              such as anchor tags (hyperlinks) and buttons, have been
              deliberately designed to have a noticeable distinction from the
              surrounding content. This approach ensures that users, including
              those with disabilities, can easily identify and interact with
              these clickable elements, enhancing the overall user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              The design of the website incorporates a high level of
              responsiveness, catering to a wide array of screen dimensions,
              varying layouts, and diverse resolutions. This adaptability allows
              the content to seamlessly adjust and optimize its presentation,
              regardless of whether it's viewed on a large desktop monitor or a
              small mobile device screen
            </li>
            <li>
              The website features a valuable accessibility enhancement in the
              form of a grayscale mode activation option. This thoughtful
              inclusion caters to users with diverse visual needs by allowing
              them to switch the display to grayscale, which can be particularly
              beneficial for those who experience color-related difficulties or
              prefer a more monochromatic visual experience.

          <ul class="report-section__answers">
            <li>
              The website's layout is thoughtfully organized, ensuring that
              visitors can effortlessly navigate and locate the information
              they're interested in. The simplicity and cleanliness of the
              design contribute to a user-friendly experience, making it easy to
              explore different sections without any confusion. The strategic
              placement of menus, buttons, and content helps users know exactly
              where to look for the content they need, enhancing their overall
              interaction with the site.
            </li>
            <li>
              The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that you can
              easily access all the information it offers, regardless of the
              device you're using. When you resize the window or access the site
              from a smaller screen, you'll notice some adaptive changes. The
              navigation bar transforms into a compact hamburger menu, allowing
              for efficient navigation even on limited screen space. The font
              size is adjusted to be smaller, making it easier to read on
              smaller screens without compromising readability. Furthermore, the
              layouts of the website adapt to different screen sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The website offers a comprehensive range of information tailored
              to individuals with a keen interest in AI. This includes an array
              of content such as job postings, details about upcoming
              conferences, a collection of AI tools, and the latest news updates
              related to the field of artificial intelligence. Whether you're
              seeking career opportunities, looking to stay updated on industry
              events, searching for useful AI tools, or simply staying informed
              about the latest developments, this website serves as a valuable
              hub for all things AI-related.

          <ul class="report-section__answers">
            <li>
              jQuery - One of the fundamental skills I needed to develop my
              website was understanding jQuery, a powerful JavaScript library
              designed to simplify HTML document traversal and manipulation, as
              well as event handling. To achieve this, I turned to the official
              jQuery documentation. The documentation provided comprehensive
              information about the library's functions, methods, and best
              practices. I gained insights into how to interact with DOM
              elements and handle user interactions more efficiently. This
              learning process allowed me to incorporate dynamic and interactive
              elements into my website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flex and Grids - Creating a visually appealing and responsive
              website required a deep understanding of CSS layout techniques. I
              decided to focus on flexbox and grid layouts to achieve this goal.
              To learn these layout methods, I turned to online resources,
              particularly YouTube tutorials. These tutorials provided
              step-by-step guidance on how to create flexible and grid-based
              layouts. By following along with the tutorials, I grasped the
              concepts of flex and grid containers, alignment properties, and
              responsive design principles. This newfound knowledge enabled me
              to design a website that adapts seamlessly to different screen
              sizes and devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Filtering - A unique challenge I faced during the website
              development process was implementing object filtering. I wanted to
              provide users with the ability to filter and sort objects
              displayed on certain pages. While there were various tutorials
              available, I decided to tackle this challenge on my own. I began
              by experimenting with different approaches, learning from my
              mistakes along the way. Through trial and error, I developed a
              custom filtering system using a combination of JavaScript and CSS
              classes. This hands-on approach not only allowed me to implement
              the desired functionality but also deepened my understanding of
              JavaScript.

            <li>
              Modern and Visually Appealing Design - I put in a lot of effort
              into the design and I'm really proud of the outcome. The website
              has a very modern feel, with colors that work well together and
              complement each other. The overall look is contemporary, and I
              believe I've successfully captured the AI atmosphere through the
              choice of colors and fonts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom Filtering Tool with JavaScript - by implementing a custom
              filtering tool using JavaScript, I have provided users with a
              powerful and user-friendly way to sort through job postings and
              tools. It was tough for me, as I am new to JavaScript and web
              development altogether, but I have managed to figure out a way to
              make filters work without any hints. Perhaps this is not the best
              implementation, but I am very proud of it. This feature enhances
              the user experience by allowing them to quickly find the most
              relevant content based on their preferences and requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              High-Quality Content Curation - The value of the website greatly
              depends on the quality of the content you provide. Again, I have
              dedicated a significant amount of time to searching for
              captivating AI news spanning various topics, as well as seeking
              out AI tools and job postings. I am proud of the content that
              populates my website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smooth and Appealing Animations - Animations can add a layer of
              interactivity and visual interest to a website. I have
              incorporated smooth and appealing animations which created an
              engaging user experience. I was new to animations and spend a lot
              of time whatching tutorials on youtube and w3 school.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessibility Considerations - I have made sure my website is
              accessible, ensuring its usability for individuals with diverse
              disabilities or limitations. I dedicated several days to making my
              website responsive, revamping a third of the CSS. I realized that
              the previous CSS wasn't capable of being responsive, unless I were
              to write an excessive number of media queries. As a result, I've
              successfully achieved full responsiveness for my website using a
              maximum of two media queries
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="report-section" id="evaluation-ii">
          <h2 class="report-section__name">Evaluation II</h2>
          <ul class="report-section__answers">
            <li>
              When I worked on improving the website's accessibility, I realized
              something important. I couldn't feasibly include both a dark and
              light theme, so I opted for only the dark one. This decision was
              influenced by the hero image I had chosen, which didn't blend well
              with a light theme. A distinctive feature of my website is that
              all the colors are derived from the hero image on the main page.
              Introducing a light theme could potentially disrupt the cohesive
              atmosphere I aimed to create. If I were to approach this again, I
              would opt to design both light and dark themes right from the
              start.
            </li>
            <li>
              A clear area for enhancement in my approach is the organization of
              CSS. I recognize that there were instances of repeated code that
              could have been avoided through creating more utility classes. To
              address this in future projects, I plan to adopt a more systematic
              approach to CSS organization. Now I understand how to better
              organize everything so that the website could be scalable and
              maintainable.
